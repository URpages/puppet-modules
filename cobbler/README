NOT WORKING YET

= Purpose = 
Install and configure my cobbler setup.  My cobbler setup probably isn't all that different than a typical cobbler setup; however, it does have the cobbler www directory in /srv.  The /var/www/cobbler directory is symlinked to that.  This is because I have all sorts of space in /srv. 

IPtables rules are not very tested at all.  I think this is what is required to make cobbler work.

  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 69 -j ACCEPT
  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25150 -j ACCEPT
  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25151 -j ACCEPT


= Default Passwords =
* The default webui password is cobbler/cobbler
* The default root password for kickstarted hosts is in /etc/cobbler/settings

= Known Issues =
* SELinux must be disabled for this to work. 



Install Cobbler
 
 SELinux must be disabled (because I suck at SELinux)

 Edit /etc/cobbler/settings

 create s symlink for /var/www/cobbler to /srv/cobbler

  install cman
  service cobblerd start
  chkconfig cobblerd on


configure the web UI (assume an LDAP server or no?)
edit /etc/cobbler/modules

distribute /etc/cobbler/users.digest
