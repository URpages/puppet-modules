# Readme file for mt-daapd module

daap_server - A DAAP server that exports your music collection via the Digital Audio Access Protocol as made famous by Apple iTunes.


This puppet module should basically do just a few things.

1.  Install mt-daapd
2.  Deliver a configuration file in /etc
3.  Enable the daemon for startup
4.  Startup the daemon


Your configuration is required for the config file in /etc.  It's an erb and can require lots of variables.  
Feel free to glance at it to know what variables to use. 




Here's my basic example of a manifest using it. 


include 'daap_server/*'

node foo inherits default {
   $daap_servername = "this will show up in iTunes"
   $mp3_dir = "/my/music/directory"
   include "daap_server"
}
