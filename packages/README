Purpose:  Install the $everyWherePackages to all systems
        Also provide variables for use in other classes/manifests

This is kind of a crappy module. I don't really like it.  It's not purpose-driven enough.

<example>
node willow {
   package { $serverPkgs: ensure => installed }
}
</example>
